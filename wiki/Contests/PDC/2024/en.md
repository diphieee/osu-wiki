## Rules

### Format

- **This is an osu! mode mapping contest.**

### Mapping

- **Submission must include ONE DIFFICULTY ONLY.**
- **Submission must use one of the provided songs.** You are only allowed to submit **ONE ENTRY** for one of the songs.
- **Collaborations are not allowed.** Submission must be a solo entry.
- **Submission must be in `.osz` format.**
- **Submission must use standard difficulty names:** Easy, Normal, Hard, Insane, and Expert.
- **You must not include a video or storyboard in your submission.**
- **You must not modify the background and metadata of your submission.** Metadata includes the title, artist, beatmap creator, source and tags.
- **You are allowed to modify timing (including red lines) based on your needs.** This action is at your own risk.
- **You are allowed to modify combo colours, bookmarks, and the preview time.**
- **Submission must not be publicly revealed until after the results are announced.**
- **The [ranking criteria](/wiki/Ranking_criteria) must be respected except in cases where they cannot be applied, such as beatmap spread.** While mistakes are tolerated, submissions containing major unrankable issues may result in a deduction of points.

### Submission

- Once you are finished, [head over to the contest listing to submit your map](https://osu.ppy.sh/community/contests/218). You are allowed to resubmit your entry anytime before the mapping phase has ended.

### Judging criteria[^criteria]

| Category | Details |
| :-: | :-- |
| Expertise (40%) | Expertise refers to how well the map executes itself to reflect the elements in the music. This reflects the technical skill of a mapper. However, in the Pending Cup, judging is not modding. Although we promote maps with expertise and professionalism and care about details, judges are discouraged from being nitpicky on small mistakes or minor unrankables, and will instead score in this category while considering an overarching picture of the map. |
| Creativity (40%) | Creativity refers to how reasonably outstanding the map is compared to the current mapping meta. A generic map in the current mapping meta or copy-pasting concepts from other "famous" maps is discouraged. The Pending Cup promotes creativity, so the winners of PDC should guide the mapping meta instead of following it. |
| Judge's Impression (20%) | Judges can use this for extra scores or penalties for their specific comments or remarks on something in the entry. The base Judge's Impression score is set to 10, and judges must explicitly mention why they apply any additions or deductions to that score. |

## Notes

[^criteria]: Judges are instructed to be consistent in their judging style across each track when judging.
